In the interpreter, upon encountering a CallNode, we will first look for the to-be-called function in all available, to the calling function, contexts and afterwards, if a match is found, the arguments, specified by the CallNode object, will be passed as the bodies of the FunctionNode objects, representing the arguments of the callee in its symbol table. Thus, they will be evaluated during the interpreting stage.
